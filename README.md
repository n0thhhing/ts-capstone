# ts-capstone
This module provides bindings for the Capstone disassembly framework.

## Quick Start
```bash
npm i ts-capstone
# note that if your using bun, you need
# to be on version 1.1.42 canary, otherwise
# you will get a Segmentation fault.
# see https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/issues/15527
bun i ts-capstone
```

## Example

```typescript
import CS, { cs_arch, cs_mode, cs_insn, ARM64 } from './path/to/capstone.ts';

const arch: cs_arch = CS.ARCH_ARM64; // or CS.ARCH_AARCH64.
const mode: cs_mode = CS.MODE_ARCH;

const code: Array<number> = [
  0x00, 0x00, 0x80, 0xd2, // 0x1000: mov x0, #0
  0xfd, 0xfb, 0xff, 0x17, // 0x1004: b #0xfffffffffffffff8
  0x88, 0x02, 0x40, 0xb9, // 0x1008: ldr w8, [x20]
  0x20, 0x00, 0x02, 0x8b, // 0x100c: add x0, x1, x2
  0x20, 0x00, 0x00, 0xf9, // 0x1010: str x0, [x1]
  0x20, 0x00, 0x42, 0xf8, // 0x1014: ldur x0, [x1, #0x20]
  0x20, 0x88, 0x82, 0x4f, // 0x1018: mul v0.4s, v1.4s, v2.s[2]
];

const cs = new CS.CAPSTONE(arch, mode);

    // specific to your chosen architecture, this
    // contains things like operands, registers,

// To reset the mnemonic, recall this with the same
// id, but with mnemonic set to null(JavaScript null)

// OPT_MODE

// after using this, your cs mode
// will be MODE_LITTLE_ENDIAN until the
// instance is closed or changed again.
cs.option(CS.OPT_MODE, CS.MODE_LITTLE_ENDIAN);

// OPT_SYNTAX

cs.option(CS.OPT_SYNTAX, CS.OPT_SYNTAX_INTEL); // Default assembly syntax of all platforms (CS.OPT_SYNTAX).

// OPT_SKIPDATA

// When disassembling binary code, there are
// often sections that contain non-executable
// data, such as ASCII strings, data structures,
// or other non-instruction bytes. By using
// CS.OPT_SKIPDATA, you can instruct Capstone
// to skip over these non-instruction bytes
// and only disassemble the actual instructions.
cs.option(
  CS.OPT_SKIPDATA,
  true, // true/false/CS.OPT_ON/CS.OPT_OFF
);

// OPT_DETAIL

// This option adds instructions/architecture
// specific detail, like operands, opcodes,
// reg_ids, groups, and in this case, a sub
// arm64 object with detailed info specific
// to the instruction and architecture.
cs.option(CS.OPT_DETAIL, true);

// OPT_BUFFER

// When enabled, this option instructs Capstone
// to include the raw instruction bytes and detail
// bytes in the disassembled output. These buffers
// contain the original bytes of the instruction
// and any associated detail information,
// respectively. Enabling this option can be
// useful when needing access to the raw
// binary data of disassembled instructions for
// further analysis or processing.
cs.option(CS.OPT_BUFFER, true);

// To access data from the buffer in JavaScript,
// use DataView. For types other than `int32`,
// little-endianness is required due to the nature
// of the underlying buffer being a Uint8Array.
// Use DataView to read the buffer as follows:

// For `int32`: Use `getInt32()` method of DataView
// directly. For other types (e.g., `uint64`),
// specify `littleEndian` as `true` in DataView
// constructor to correctly interpret the bytes.
let buffer = /* Raw buffer received from the insn object */;
let view = new DataView(buffer.buffer);
let id = view.getUint32(0, true); // Read the 32-bit integer id from the buffer with little-endian.
let address = view.getBigUint64(8, true); // Read a 64-bit integer address with little-endian.

// Also for things like strings(cstrings in this case),
// you can simply use a TextDecoder, each character is
// stored as a int8 anyways so all you have to do is
// throw `utf-8` in the TextDecoder constructor
const mnemonic_bytes =
  buffer.slice(
    42, // offset for the mnemonic
    74 // 74 - 42 = 32 = CS.MNEMONIC_SIZE
  )

// TextDecoder doesn't automatically stop at null
// terminator, this isn't needed if your simply
// inspecting it, but for comparisons there will
// be trailing `\u0000`
const mn_null_index = mn_bytes.indexOf(0);
const truncated_mn =
    mn_null_index !== -1 ? mn_bytes.subarray(0, mn_null_index) : mn_bytes; // slice off every trailing null terminator

const mnemonic = new TextDecoder("utf-8").decode(truncated_mn)

// offsets are as follows:
// id: 0
// address: 8
// size: 16
// bytes: 18
// mnemonic: 42
// op_str: 74
// detail: 0 in the insn.detail.buffer

// NOT IMPLEMENTED

// OPT_SKIPDATA_SETUP: will need to implement a way to create the callback this needs, while still keeping as little memory management as possible.
// OPT_UNSIGNED: to little documentation.
// OPT_MEM: unnecessary because you won't need to worry about any memory management.

// support

// this will return a boolean, true if valid
// and false if not, To verify if this library
// supports all the archs, use CS.ARCH_ALL(true),
// To check if this library is in 'diet' mode,
// set query to CS.SUPPORT_DIET(false).
cs.support(CS.MODE_LITTLE_ENDIAN); // true

// version

// The version of capstone this library is using.
cs.version(); // 5.0

// group_name

// This returns the name of the group
// that an instruction can belong to
// These groups can be found in the
// arch/<arch>.ts file or the detail obj
// when CS_DETAIL is turned on.
cs.group_name(2); // call

// reg_name

// These register IDs can be found either in
// the arch/<arch>.ts file or the detail object
// when CS.DETAIL is on, like regs_read/regs_write.
cs.reg_name(183); // w15

// insn_name

// This returns the name of the mnemonic
// corresponding to the id. The id can be
// found either from the (arch/<arch>.ts)
// file or from disassembly results.
cs.insn_name(191); // s28

// op_index

// This retrieves the "position" of the given type.
// This can be used to determine operands without
// having to manually inspect the operands array.
// This requires the detail object to be present in
// the insn, so CS.OPT_DETAIL needs to be turned on
cs.op_index(example_insn, ARM64.OP_REG, 1); // 1

// op_count

// This retrieves the operand count for the input
// type provided an insn, which allows you to easily
// tell how many of a certain type is present in the
// object while not having to manually inspect the
// detail object. This requires the detail object to
// be present in the insn, so CS.OPT_DETAIL needs
// to be turned on
cs.op_count(example_insn, ARM64.OP_REG); // 1

// regs_access

// Retrieve all the registers accessed by an
// instruction, either explicitly or implicitly.
cs.regs_access(example_insn); // { regs_read: [], regs_read_count: 0, regs_write: [], regs_write_count: 0 }

// reg_read

// Check if a disassembled instruction IMPLICITLY
// used a particular register. These registers can
// be found in the constants file corresponding to
// your chosen architecture (arch/<arch>.ts)
cs.reg_read(example_insn, ARM64.REG_NZCV); // false

// reg_write

// Check if a disassembled instruction IMPLICITLY
// modified a particular register. These registers can
// be found in the constants file corresponding to
// your chosen architecture (arch/<arch>.ts)
cs.reg_write(example_insn, ARM64.REG_B0); // false

// insn_group

// Check if a disassembled instruction belong to a
// particular group. You can find these groups
// in the constants file corresponding to your
// chosen architecture (arch/<arch>.ts)
cs.insn_group(example_insn, ARM64.GRP_PRIVILEGE); // true


// fmt

// This method is used to format the instruction
// (or instructions) to be printable, this also
// includes an option param that goes as follows:
const options = {
  bytes: true, // Specifies if the formatted string should have the instructions bytes(default is true).
  address: true, // Specifies if the formatted string should include the instructions address(default is true).
  ASCII: true, // Specifies if the formatted string should include the bytes ASCII representation(default is false).
}
const formatted_insn = cs.fmt(example_insn, options)
console.log(formatted_insn)
/*
output:
0x1008 0c 05 13 d5 .... msr dbgdtrtx_el0, x12
*/

// close

// this closes the Capstone instance, because we
// are binding c to JS we now have to free unused
// values, JS usually has garbage collection
// but C does not, so we have to free the
// capstone instance from memory manually
// after it's no longer in use.
cs.close();
```

you can also take a look at the [tests](src/tests) for more specific examples.

## Constants

if you would like to see all the options and capstone
constants, you can find them in either the [capstone.ts](src/capstone.ts)
file or the [typescript file](src/arch) (arch/\<arch>.ts) for things like
register ids, options, error codes, groups, opcodes,
manifest constants, insns, ect

## Compatibility

Although all core functions have been implemented to
the best of my ability some helper functions and options
haven't and soon will if they are relivant, all of this includes
the following.

| Case             | Compatibility |                                                       Notes |
| :--------------- | :-----------: | ----------------------------------------------------------: |
| Detail           |      ✅       |               Everything has also been checked and verified |
| Architectures    |      ✅       |                                   Eveything relative to 5.0 |
| Options          |      ❌       |                   OPT_MEM, OPT_SKIPDATA_SETUP, OPT_UNSIGNED |
| Helper functions |      ✅       | Everything including helper functions have been implemented |
| Web              |      ❔       |                                                    untested |

## Building

### Prerequisites

1. download the [capstone library](https://github.com/capstone-engine/capstone/releases/tag/5.0.1):
2. Make sure you have bun and emsdk installed
3. Install dependancies

```shell
npm i -D
```

### Makefile

The makefile provides some commands for necessary builds, which includes...

- `compile`: Compiles capstone into a static library via emcmake
- `build`: Transpiles the static library file into js via emcc(requires make compile first)
- `type`: Genorates declaration files
- `bundle`: Bundles the source into one file via Bun.build
- `format`: Formats everything
- `compare`: A check to see if everything is the same as it is in the official capstone(manual)

### Initializing

```typescript
import Module from "./capstone.js"; // capstone.js should be in the src directory after building
import Memory from "./memory.ts"; // utilities for working with memory

const Capstone = new Module();
// Use as necessary
// ...
```
